      "A normalized date table is a table in a database or analytics system that stores comprehensive and standardized information about dates. It is designed to provide a central reference for date-related calculations and analysis.
       The purpose of using a normalized date table is to ensure data consistency, optimize query performance, and enable efficient time-based analysis. By having a dedicated table for date information, it allows for easy referencing and joining with other tables that contain date-related data.
       By using a normalized date table, analysts can easily connect and join it with other tables that contain date-related data (e.g., sales data, customer data) in a consistent and efficient manner. It facilitates time-based analysis, such as comparing data across different periods, calculating year-over-year growth, or aggregating data by various date dimensions."
