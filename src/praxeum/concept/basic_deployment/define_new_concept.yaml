  Given the brand new concept {concept_name}


  You need to find the following to define the new concept:
    1. You need to create a very detailed definition definition of the concept. The definition should contain the details for a concept, how it is used, and how it relates to the key concepts in a {system} system for the {process} process.
    2. You need to find the base concept this concept will derive from. 
    3. You need to find the constraint clause and the properties on the new concept. Be absolutely certain you use the base concept found from step 2.

  Define the new concept. Create a very detailed definition definition of the concept based on your knowledge as the very first thing
