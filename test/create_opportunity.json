  "concept_definition": "An Opportunity in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a sales prospect or deal that has the potential to generate revenue for a business. It represents a possible sale for a company's product or service. \n\nIn a CRM system, an Opportunity is typically a record or an object that contains relevant information about the potential deal, such as the prospective customer's details, the expected close date, the potential revenue, the sales stage (e.g., qualification, proposal, negotiation), and the probability of closing the deal. \n\nOpportunities are used in the sales process to track and manage potential deals. They are typically linked to other external objects such as Accounts (the companies you're selling to), Contacts (the individuals you're dealing with at the account), and Products or Services (what you're selling). \n\nIn relation to the revenue reporting process, Opportunities play a crucial role. The aggregated potential revenue from all Opportunities, weighted by their probability of closing, often forms a company's sales forecast. This forecast is a key input into the revenue reporting process. \n\nMoreover, once an Opportunity is won, it becomes actual revenue, which is then reported in the company's financial statements. Therefore, Opportunities are directly linked to both projected and actual revenue, making them a key concept in the revenue reporting process."
